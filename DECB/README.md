Here is the early DECB version of a web browser prototype. All it's going to do is connect to a hardcoded IP address, ask for a page and stream it to the screen. 
When we get to the end of the page, we won’t respond, the web server will get mad at us and hang up. As simple a working example as I could come up with. 

To configure, edit these lines:

Local address
1120 replace decimal numbers 192 168 0 1 with IP address of your router
1160 replace decimal numbers 192 168 0 7 with an unused IP address @home

Remote 
  20 replace ‘/cocoio/index.html’ with name or path to target web page
  22 replace ‘play-classics.net’ with the web server hostname
1250 replace decimal numbers 192 168 0 124 with IP address of a web server

To read, here is a variable decoder ring. 
```
LOCAL VARS
   A,B,C,D,E,F,G,W$,X$ - TEMP RESULT
   I,J     - LOOP INDEX
   S     - STATUS

NATIONAL VARS
   EB       - END OF BUFFER
   SG       - DATA SEGMENT SIZE
   SS       - STRING START (slicing)

GLOBAL VARS
   RB, WB   - BASE ADDRESS R,W BUFFER
   RL,WL    - DATA LENGTH
   RM, WM   - MASKOF R,W BUFFER
   WP,RP    - R,W POINTER (from 5100)
   RZ, WZ   - R,W SIZEOF DATA
```
and a sort of outline.
```
